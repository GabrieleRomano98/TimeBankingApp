# TimeBankingApp
 
Android application developed for a group project<br/>
The app allows users to publish and book buy work performances, called timeslots, using time as a currency.<br/>
Every timeslots has several text fields and an image, selected from the gallery or taken with the camera.<br/>
Timeslots are organized according to their category and every user has a section for those he published, one for his favourites and one for those he accepted.<br/>
The app has a chat system to allow users to communicate and a reviews system.<br/>

The application relies on FireBase and is completely developed in Kotlin. A ViewModel is used to store data and the UI/UX is built according to usability principles and guidelines.<br/>
